Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code contributions are not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping others, and improving the documentation are also immensely valuable.

However you choose to contribute, please be mindful and respect our code of conduct.

This guide was heavily inspired by the awesome scikit-learn guide to contributing.

Submitting a bug-related issue or feature request

Did you find a bug?

Before you report an issue, we would really appreciate it if you could make sure the bug was not already reported (use the search bar on GitHub under Issues). Your issue should also be related to bugs in the library itself, and not your code. If you're unsure whether the bug is in your code or the library, please ask in the forum first. This helps us respond quicker to fixing issues related to the library versus general questions.

Once you've confirmed the bug hasn't already been reported, please include the following information in your issue so we can quickly resolve it:

A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug in less than 30s.
The full traceback if an exception is raised.
Attach any other additional information, like screenshots, you think may help.

Do you want to add documentation?
We're always looking for improvements to the documentation that make it more clear and accurate. Please let us know how the documentation can be improved such as typos and any content that is missing, unclear or inaccurate. We'll be happy to make the changes or help you make a contribution if you're interested!

For more details about how to generate, build, and write the documentation, take a look at the documentation.

For more information about the checks run on a pull request, take a look at our Checks on a Pull Request guide.
